<h2><strong>AT THE SIGN POST UP AHEAD, YOUR NEXT STOP, ADDERALL CITY</strong></h2>
<p>The world we live in is frenetic and often convoluted. Given this, it&rsquo;s easy to become distracted, and, essentially, fall off the track we&rsquo;ve established for ourselves.</p>
<p>This is especially true for younger people who <em>have not yet </em>established their path in life.</p>
<p>Between the obligations of school, family, and community, as well as the additional disruptions that come with social media, video games, and peer pressure, we (naturally or not) expect them to be distracted.</p>
<p>In some people, this can be defined as Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), while others simply claim it&rsquo;s a lack of concentration. One way or the other, consultation and treatment may be needed, and what is commonly administered for ADHD is <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/adderall-uses-abuses">Adderall</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>WHAT IS ADDERALL </strong></h2>
<p>Adderall is one the <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/the-5-prescription-drugs-medical-marijuana-may-one-day-replace-part-1">most commonly prescribed medications</a> in America. Its popularity with health providers ranks just behind only a few more prolific drugs, such as Suboxone, which is an addictive opioid used to combat more powerful opioid addictions.</p>
<p>Adderall contains a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine and dextroamphetamine are central nervous system stimulants that affect chemicals in the brain and nerves that contribute to hyperactivity and impulse control.</p>
<p>In addition to ADHD, Adderall is also used to treat those who suffer from narcolepsy.</p>
<h2><strong>HOW ADDICTIVE IS ADDERALL?</strong></h2>
<h2>Adderall works by increasing dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine, the body&rsquo;s &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; chemical, creates a rewarding effect. Although dopamine occurs naturally, drugs like Adderall produce unnaturally high levels of it. This can cause users to come back for more.<strong></strong></h2>
<p>The brain of an addicted person is dependent on Adderall to stimulate alertness and productivity. Without Adderall, addicted people often feel tired and mentally foggy. </p>
<h2><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>SIGNS OF ADDERALL ADDICTION</strong></h2>
<p>There can be many warning signs that a friend or loved one displays when addicted to Adderall. Here are some of the more common signs:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Needing larger doses to feel the      drug&rsquo;s effects</li>
  <li>Taking the drug despite knowledge of      the harm it&rsquo;s causing</li>
  <li>Not being able to finish work      without Adderall</li>
  <li>Spending a lot of money getting the      drug</li>
  <li>Being unable to feel alert without      the drug</li>
</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ADDERALL CITY</strong></h2>
<p>Imagine a metropolis where the entire population is addicted to one drug. It&rsquo;s as if you&rsquo;re in a city of zombies.</p>
<p>With the distractions we have today, and all the consequences of life that could push us off track, or worse, cause us to never even get on track, an Adderall City could easily be made of our own hometowns.</p>
<p>If your loved one has been placed on Adderall, try to help them adjust as best you can by having them focus more clearly on a goal or responsibility. Soon, hopefully, there will no longer be a need for an Adderall City, or even Adderall as a drug or name.</p>
